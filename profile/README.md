Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with a strong focus on full-stack development. Over the past few years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages including JavaScript, Python, and Java. My primary expertise lies in creating feature-rich web applications using frameworks such as React and Node.js, while also leveraging backend technologies such as Django and Express.js.

I have a deep interest in algorithm design and data structures, which I believe are fundamental for writing efficient and scalable code. My experience extends to working with databases including MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, ensuring that I can manage data effectively in my applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I am an advocate for clean code and best practices in software development. I believe in the importance of writing maintainable code and utilizing Agile methodologies to foster collaboration and efficiency in team projects. My commitment to continuous learning drives me to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.

I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers from around the world. Some of my most proud repositories include a task management tool built with MERN stack, a Python-based data visualization project that helped in understanding complex datasets, and a mobile application developed using React Native.

In my spare time, I love exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, and engaging in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and Codewars. I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, while also sharing knowledge with others in the developer community.

Feel free to check out my pinned repositories to see my work and contributions. I look forward to connecting with like-minded developers and working on innovative projects together!
